        "As decision trees keep expanding till they run out of features or till they find a pure node, therefore there is a very high chance of overfitting on the training data. Decision tree will split on the nodes that are not actually important if it is favourable. This causes decision trees to perform perfectly on training data but sometimes fail on testing data. Pruning definitely helps to some extent but even it does not consider how important a feature is. Decision tree may be going to a direction on the basis of some useless features at the starting levels of the tree and thus it effects the decision. Pruning may improve the error but error will still remain."

These features mentioned are comparitively less useful as compared to our earlier features (which were projects, college and internships). But there can be a case where our data-set has positive results corresponding to blue colour of resume and resume having the applicant's picture. Therefore, our decision tree may have these as deciding features and gives true as soon as these two are present in a particular resume."
